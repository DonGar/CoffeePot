### Coffee Pot ###

This repo is for an Arduino controller for refilling the water tank in a Keurig style coffee pot.

It uses:

 * Float switch input to detect low water levels.
 * Water valve controlled by a single pin to fill the tank.
 * Status LED to (mostly) show that water is currently flowing.
